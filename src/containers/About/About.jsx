    <p> I'm a Biologist working towards
transitioning into a long-term career in tech.🪴
<br /> 
Following a successful 13-month placement, I
challenged myself to venture into new areas and
discovered the world of programming. 🖥️ 
<br /> 
I fell in love with programming as I completed a
self-directed 300-hour Web development course
by FreeCodeCamp and Bright
Network’s Python intro course. 🤩
<br />
Following this, I
applied to and was accepted into the _nology
Technology Consultancy Programme. 🏢 </p>
